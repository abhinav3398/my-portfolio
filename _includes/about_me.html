            I have over 1 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack
            developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services using python-django and in practical applications of deep learning.
        </p>

           I love building and solving things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving optimization problems with a simple mathematical justification.
           I'm looking for a junior individual contributor role where I can take on collaborative
           team-player responsibilites, and gain experience with my colleagues on data-architecture and project management.
